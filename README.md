# elmer-elmag
This is a development repository for electromagnetics tutorial and verification cases.  

The idea is to have something more helpful than just some consistency tests and something that don't need to be in form of ElmerGUI tuturials. This could evolve with the needs. Perhaps some of the cases will find their way to official tutorials. 

The tutorials will probably mainly cover the 3D solvers based on edge elements as these are of greatest interest. However, also cases with other electrocmagnetics files are welcome.
